  desc:  Sometimes I hunt for typos on restaurant menus, at other times I play drums for the band in my head. Mostly, I'm learning & building components for the internet.
    # also, you should see the look on my face when i spot a typo on a restaurant menu :D
    # A software developer driven by passion, excellence and the belief that the future will be written in code.
    # I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects and technologies that require me to work outside my comfort-zone
    # and knowledge set, as continuing to learn and overcome challenges fuel my growth.
